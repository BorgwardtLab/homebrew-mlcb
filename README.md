This is the [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) tap repository of the [Machine Learning and Computational Biology
Lab](https://www.bsse.ethz.ch/mlcb), led by [Prof. Karsten Borgwardt](https://www.bsse.ethz.ch/mlcb/karsten.html).

To use the formulas in this repository, please issue the following
command:

This will import *all* formulas into your local installation such
that you may use

    $ brew install NAME

subsequently in order to install individual packages.
